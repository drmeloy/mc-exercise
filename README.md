## Things that they did wrong:
    - Not pulling from origin master before creating a branch (big no no!)
    - Not communicating about merging branches into master (so that others others knew to update master)
    - Multiple people touching the same content

# What they should have done but failed to do
    - Pull from origin master before creating a branch
    - Compartmentalize work
    - Should have left comments when reviewing others' code so that the others knew their code had merge conflicts (we only knew because we were next to one another)
